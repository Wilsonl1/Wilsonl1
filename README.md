### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**Wilsonl1** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- I am currently a Frontend Software Developer intern with YearUp.
- I am currently learning JavaScript.
- I am currently preparing for a group Capstone project.

- I am highly interested in building projects with others, so if you have any ideas lets build them.
- Ask me about my projects i've completed so far
- I also am going to copy and update some of the projects from when I first started coding with javaScript so stayed tuned.
